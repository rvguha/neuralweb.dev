// Threadstore: conversation threads that survive a reload.
//
// The interface used to keep its conversation in `const history = []`, which
// works and vanishes on reload. The server cannot help — /ask is stateless by
// design — so the browser owns the thread.
//
// Nothing is stored by reference. The corpus is rebuilt, re-extracted and
// re-emitted constantly; a reference resolves to whatever the corpus says now,
// which is precisely not what you were shown. Every turn is stored whole,
// schema_object and all, so reopening a thread shows what you saw whatever has
// happened to the repository since. That is affordable because JSON-LD
// compresses about tenfold — the repeated @context, @type and property names
// are nearly free — so a turn costs roughly 16 KB gzipped rather than 156 KB.
//
// Compression is per turn, not per thread, so appending never rewrites history.
